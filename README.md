# Tar Heel Reader 2017

A prototype for the Tar Heel Reader Project.

This started life as the output of create-react-app, then I added the
changes from https://github.com/mobxjs/create-react-app-mobx and
further added bits from https://github.com/mweststrate/state-routing-blog-sources
to get a little demo that includes react, mobx, and integratng routing/url updates. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
